# Semantics

Unit 7 introduces semantics. Semantics store data using a subject-predicate-
object format (an RDF triple). This is a very flexible format and can be used 
for storing a wide diversity of information. 

Combined with documents, triples can provide context for and connections among 
entities. 

Load the semantics.xml workspace into Query Console to see how to work with 
triples.
