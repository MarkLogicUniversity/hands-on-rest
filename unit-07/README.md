Unit 07 introduces transformations. You can apply transforms to documents 
during read, during write, to search results, and to value results.

01-install-add-image-size.js illustrates how to deploy a transform. In this
case, it deploys the code in add-image-size.js.

02-read-doc.js then applies the add-image-size while reading a single document,
adding the size of the binary associated with the JSON data.

The exercises challenge you to apply these techiques to write a search
transform, deploy it, and make use of it during a search.
