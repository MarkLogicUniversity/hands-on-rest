Unit 2 shows how to use Node.js's built-in debugging while working with 
MarkLogic's Node Client API. 

In this unit, we will cover:

- Running in debug mode
- [Node Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector)
  - `$ node-debug 01-read-promise.js`
- setting breakpoints
  - statically ("debugger")
  - dynamically (sb)
- debugger commands (next, step, out, run, cont, watch)
- REPL
- JSHint -- reminder to remove "debugger" statements
